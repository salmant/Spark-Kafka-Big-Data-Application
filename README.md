The CVS Big Data project is designed and implemented upon a zero-downtime, scalable microservices architecture providing different functionalities:
* Streaming analytics in real-time / Batch processing / Visualisation dashboard
* Vehicle tracking e.g. direction, GPS, mapping, navigation, etc. using HERE.com and Google Map APIs
* Driver behaviour profiling using AI and Fuzzy Logic

The CVS Big Data application includes various container-based components deployable on cloud, fog and edge computing infrastructures:
* Kafka Producer: Edge Processing on Raspberry Pi
* Kafka Broker: Distributed streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day for messages passed within the system.
* Spark Processor: Streaming Analytics in real-time on the cloud
* Database Server: Apache Cassandra time series database
* etc.
